## 🔍 What is Λ-System?

**Λ-System** is a structure-first mathematical framework designed to model complex, evolving systems beyond the limitations of traditional set-based mathematics. It introduces a formal structural language capable of expressing semantic transformation, boundary coupling, and long-term stability in real-world domains.

## 🧱 Core Concepts

- **Λ-Unit**: The basic modeling element, defined as a triplet ⟨σ, ∂, φ⟩ representing internal configuration, boundary interaction, and stability.
- **Operators**: Structural calculus including ⊕ (fusion), ⊗ (boundary coupling), 7→ (evolution), ∇ (stability evaluation).
- **Graph Representation**: Real-world systems can be expressed as Λ-graphs supporting structural compression, attractor detection, and semantic flows.

## 🌍 Application Areas

- **Biological Systems** – gene block modeling, protein folding, regulatory logic  
- **Urban Infrastructure** – traffic network compression, spatial planning  
- **AI Semantics** – conceptual transitions, knowledge evolution  
- **Social Systems** – conflict modeling, influence boundary analysis  
- **Theoretical Physics** – structural attractors in quantum and cosmological systems
